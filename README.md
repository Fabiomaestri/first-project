# Deployment and Demo
Website has been deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Fabiomaestri/first-project).

# Wireframe
The wireframe was designed using [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/) and links to the final version can be found below:
- [Wireframe Final Version]()

# UX
I have opted to a simple and responsive design which is lightweight and has a loading time of less than 1 second.
- Home page: Contains a jumbotron and a background image for the main section which resizes accordingly depending on user's viewport size
- About us page: Contains a fixed image in the main section and a set of card elements at the bottom section for the philosophy of the company
- Schools page: Contains a jumbotron and a background image for the main section which resizes accordingly depending on user's viewport size. Contains a school section bellow, with cards design responsevely, users can have great experience with modern and light style. We also add a filter where users can personalize their search and improve the UX.
- School profile page: Contain complete information of the school, we decided acordingly with ux to add a menu in the bottom to give users precise navigation, during their experience. We only use basic code but it is well design to show all services they have in just one place.
- contact page: Contact page contains a contact form in basic style.

In order to improve user experience and website loading speed, I have compressed the images using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) and the reduction in image size has been 57%.

![Website Speed Test Results](assets/images/speed_test.png)
The points below can be improved with a bit more optimization:
- Serving scaled images (some images are being resized in CSS e.g. logo.png)
- Leveraging browser caching

# Scalability
Using a back-end programming language and database, I'd like to have a fully featured CMS which can be used by non-technical people to create, read, update and delete data easily.
Also, I'd like to have a private section where partners can find resources and talk directly to our customer service representatives.
